# TouchGradientPicker

TouchGradientPicker is a UIKit framework for displaying and editing color gradients.

- Render gradients with a simple UIView subclass and a couple lines of code
- Build a customized control for editing gradients
- Gradient picker uses no sliders or buttons: all input is gesture-based for an analog, organic feel; you can build a beautiful full-screen picker
- 100% Swift, iOS 8 required
- Abstract API, extensible via subclassing and functional programming
- Flexible layout options: gradient display and editor input are separate views that can be laid however you please, in IB or programmatically
